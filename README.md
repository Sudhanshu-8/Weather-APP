# Welcome to the Weather App 🌧️

This is a simple Weather App project using [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Fetches real-time weather data for a specified city.
- Displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- Mobile-friendly design with Bootstrap integration.
- Multiple cities supported.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite code editor.

3. Add your API key from [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) in the `script.js` file:

   ```javascript
   const apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
   ```

4. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the app.

## How It Works

The app fetches data from the OpenWeather API using JavaScript's `fetch()` method. The information is dynamically displayed on the webpage using HTML and styled with Bootstrap.
